<Title> Noisy
<Content> The hotel is beautiful but noisy. There is a busy road between the hotel and the ocean - the noise from the road is LOUD - even four floors up! Tonight, Wednesday, there is a party by the pool. The music is BLASTING and it is almost midnight! Would have been nice for the staff to notify us of this when we made the reservation.
