<Title> Wasn't totally up to Holiday Inn standards
<Content> We did get a room just walking in, and room was conveniently on 2nd floor, but the hallway smelled strange and the room was only ho-hum. Bar was convenient and friendly staff. I might stay here again but came here since the Hampton Inn was full.
<Overall> 3
