<Title> Million dollar view!
<Content> The hotel sits in front of the fun St. Kilda beaches, I happened to be there for the sunday market, which offers cute finds. Plenty of dinning options and shopping just around the corner. Rooms may need maintenance, AC was too loud, also amenities do not include conditioner.
<Overall> 4
