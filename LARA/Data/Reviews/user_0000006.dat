<Title> Convienient airport hotel
<Content> The hotel is close to the airport (15 mins) and next to a shopping mall with a good selection of food (the regular fastfood chains and an indonesian foodcourt). Prices are reasonanle and service is ok with an airport shuttle on the way to the airport. We booked an executive room which was good with a seating area and a big bathroom (bath and seperate shower). I would book this hotel again
<Overall> 5

<Title> Pity it's at the airport
<Content> My husband and I were travelling with our 5 y old so it was easier to stay here for the night on arrival in Singapore before moving to Sentosa. I think we may have been given an upgrade as my husband is a member but regardless our room was great: very spacious with a huge bed. However I found the bed a bit hard to sleep on. Our child was given a trundle bed which was fine.
<Overall> 4
