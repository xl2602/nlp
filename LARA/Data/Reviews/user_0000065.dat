<Title>  Great access to transport links
<Content> Arrived at Alexanderplatz by train from the airport and was checked into the hotel 10min later. Really nice room on the 6th floor looking over the square (not the most glamorous view but even so). Twin bed was two singles pushed together but the bed was comfortable. The shower was really fantastic and there was a few English speaking channels on the TV. Staff were very pleasant at check in and out as well as at the bar within the hotel. I didn't have breakfast at the hotel.
<Overall> 4
