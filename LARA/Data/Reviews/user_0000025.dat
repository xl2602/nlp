<Title> Amazing hotel
<Content> My girlfriend and I stayed here for our 40th birthday trip in October 2014 and staying at the Vdara made our holiday that extra bit special. We were upgraded upon arrival and our room was on the 52 floor over looking the Bellagio fountains and all of the strip and vegas! Absolutely breathtaking views and the room was just as great. The bed was super comfy, large bathroom, modern and clean. Price was outstanding for what we got and the staff were always polite and smiling. Defiantly would stay here over and over and highly recommend to anyone travelling to Las Vegas. Thanks to all hotel staff for putting us up and making our trip that extra bit more special. Also the star bucks located in the lobby make a great coffee which kick started me everyday and the staff were very nice. 10/10 for this hotel.
