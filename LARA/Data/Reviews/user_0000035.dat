<Title> Great girls weekend
<Content> Stayed here this Memeorial day weekend. had a great time nice property great staff Erica who checked us in at the front desk fantastic job and just lovely. Nice patio to sit out and enjoy wine great bartenders who ebbed blended us a special birthday drink! Couple blocks from Beale street. our room overlooked Silky Ullivans bar. Beware bring earplugs because the music may keep you up. There is not a swimming pool here and the gym is nothing to write home about. Restaurant was fine for breakfast there is a Starbucks around the corner if you chose to go there instead of the hotel.stafff all very friendly
