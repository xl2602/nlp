<Title> Nice hotel but rooftop pool/bar issues
<Content> We booked the James for a "staycation" over Memorial Day weekend with our main purpose of enjoying their rooftop pool. Unfortunately, our experience left a lot to be desired. The pool apparently is managed by the rooftop bar the Jimmy and apparently they are under new management which explains the service issues. First of all, there was no drink/food service at all at the pool (we had to track multiple people down to figure out how to order room service up there) and the bar itself did not open until 1pm! Additionally, we were informed that at 2:45pm, that he lounge chairs would be turned into benches for the bar and we could not lay out any longer. I understand promoting the night club however there is no reason this turnover needs to happen so early in the afternoon and prevent paying guests from enjoying this amenity. The management tried to explain that the pool area has different management but that is no excuse. We were extremely upset as this was not disclosed to us at booking or at check-in and basically ruined half the day. Also,there was no music at the pool during the day and the pool was not heated and freezing.
