<Title> Stunning apartment in the midst of it all
<Content> From the convenient check in facility to the well appointed rooms, every aspect of this company is well thought out. The apartment faced a pedistratian area on Laugaveger where it was super convenient with our two young children in tow. The apartment was well stocked with coffee, tea, and other cooking essentials that made the self catered experience super easy. On two nights, we bought amazing char and lamb from the supermarket on the same street and had a wonderful local Icelandic meal at home. The apartment is decked out with the highest end linens and appliances. The kids enjoyed the terrace where we could admire the city. All in all, you will not go wrong with this company based on the standards we saw with our specific apartment.
