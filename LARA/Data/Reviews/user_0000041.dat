<Title> Adjacent to GWU and Clean
<Content> Handy location near GWU and two metros stations couple blocks away, this is our second stay here. Large suite-like rooms with separate kitchen/fridge and coffee-maker. Waffle bathrobes, nice linens, frette towels. No slippers and too fat pillows. I wish pillows were softer, my neck hurt afterwards all day. Bellboys, bartender in Venetian all super and helpful, thanks. Will stay again, maybe they will get sofert slmmer pillows in the meantime....
