<Title> Dream location for pedestrians
<Content> Aside from a perfect central location within Copenhagen, the hotel is spacious, so are the double rooms (but not the single rooms though from what we gathered from friends staying also). It seems from looking at the interior plan of the hotel and the number of rooms per floor that it has been redesigned to fit as many rooms as possible. Despite this little inescapable market-trend feature, the Victorian style hotel is remarkably well maintained and managed.
