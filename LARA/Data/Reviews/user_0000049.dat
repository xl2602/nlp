<Title> Perfect, fantastic hotel
<Content> We have been coming to Paris for many years and usually have stayed at the grand hotels, like the George V or Plaza and most recently the new Shangri-La. On this trip, our organizing company (Inspirato) had rooms for us during the busy fashion week at La Reserve. After googling it, and seeing great recommendations including Cond?? Nast, we had to try it. We were absolutely not disappointed and this will be our new go-to hotel. Rooms are warm and modern but super comfortable; common spaces are chic and feel very Parisian and elegant; staff is the best I have seen in Paris, and while to some extent that has been a low bar at other places, the staff here is exceptional. They knew each day what our plans were - which lunches and dinners (which the concierge had arranged, at great places) - so our room was cleaned perfectly, they had cars for us, it was all easily done. The place has an intimate feel, a great location, a fun-to-watch clientele (and a very high end Japanese style toilet, nothing wrong with that!). Whenever we had any request of the concierge/butler/front desk, they were handled immediately. I cannot think of anything to fault, I wish we had time for the pool and spa so that will be next time, but will make this our first choice for Paris!
