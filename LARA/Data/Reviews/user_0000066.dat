<Title> Great Option In Orange
<Content> Stayed for just 1 night in the 'executive' suite. Room was large, and well equiped. Kitchen seemed to be well enough equiped for cooking if needed. On arrival room was clean and tidy.Nice outdoor patio area. Location is very central, only 5 minutes walk to the centre of Orange, a lot closer to the centre than other options in this price range.Check in/out was painless.Free internet access in the mornings and evenings. Cable TV had limited chanels. Would be happy to stay here again if I was ever in Orange.
<Overall> 4
