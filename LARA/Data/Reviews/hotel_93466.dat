<Title> good location, bad hotel
<Content> Stayed there 4 nights. 1. The location is very convenient, right next to a subway and a little restaurant where you can have a good breakfast. 2. Standard welcome, nothing special to say. 3. The floor in our room was completely wet when we get in. We immediately called the front desk and ask to be changed when we'll be back from our dinner. Then we got out to have dinner. When we came back nobody knew about the change request and we had to explain and show again. We finally got another room, better. 4. The carpet seemed old... and certainly not hygienic (stains, bad feeling about it...). Very standard bathroom, not refurbished for a while. 5. The persons at the front desk were not helpful, working like robots. We won't come again.
