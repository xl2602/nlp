<Title> Perfect stay for a family
<Content> I just spent 5 days here with my daughter, son in law and grandson. We had a 2 room suite with a full kitchen and living area. The daily breakfast with omelet station was terrific. The service was friendly and very accommodating. I really appreciate how soft the bath towels are! We didn't use the work out facility or swimming pool but they looked very nice and well maintained. This hotel has free parking and is just off the freeway. We had a terrific stay!
