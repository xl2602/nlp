<Title> Pity it's at the airport
<Content> My husband and I were travelling with our 5 y old so it was easier to stay here for the night on arrival in Singapore before moving to Sentosa. I think we may have been given an upgrade as my husband is a member but regardless our room was great: very spacious with a huge bed. However I found the bed a bit hard to sleep on. Our child was given a trundle bed which was fine.
<Overall> 4
