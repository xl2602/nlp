<Title> One of the finest resorts in the South
<Content> I've stayed here many times. The best rooms (in my opinion) are the ones on the ground floor with patios that open out onto the grounds overlooking the lake. This is an exquisitely maintained resort that caters to both the younger ones with the S'mores making around the fire to a fabulous wine list for the older kids. We took a boat tour that was relaxing and informative. The cottages there are perfect for family groups.
<Overall> 5
