<Title> I love it!
<Content> Everything was great. Location - close to the air train station. Rooms - huge and with outstanding view and design. Breakfast - fill of choices. Swimming pool - infinity - fantastic. Very helpfull staff. Spa - overpriced, but a staff to die for (kindness and professionalism). Hotel restaurant very good. Roof top bar wit exceptional view! Overall - worth another stay!
