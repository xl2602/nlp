<Title> ocean view wing "simply fantastic"
<Content> have just returned from 8 nights at the rasa ria in the ocean view wing and cannot recommend this place highly enough.....the service,the food,the golf course are all top notch and the rooms are some of the biggest you"ll ever see,with fantastic balconies over looking the beach...the ocean view wing has its own lobby,swimming pool and restaurant for breakfast and to be honest is worth paying the extra for..
<Overall> 5
