<Title> Excellent service as usual
<Content> I've been coming to this hotel a few times every year for the past 9 years and my experiences have largely been excellent. Service is pretty quick when checking in/out and the rooms and beds are in good condition despite the relative age of the hotel. The rooftop restaurant is excellent quality. One request, please keep the beers on ice on the 5th floor bar! Also, the "security" on the front door is almost meaningless, everyone beeps but no one is ever checked that I've seen. More for show than effect.
<Overall> 5
