<Title> Nice New Hotel in Bogota!
<Content> Really enjoyed my stay at this newer hotel. Rooms are very modern, nice, clean, shower is huge. I was a solo traveler on this trip, so didn't mind the limited separation between the bathroom and bed. Concierge was outstanding as well as the front desk staff. I'll be back!
<Overall> 4
