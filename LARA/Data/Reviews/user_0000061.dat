<Title> Comfortable Oasis at London-Heathrow Airport
<Content> As airport hotels go, this property fit the bill - comfortable, clean lodging for a one-night stay. Within walking distance of London-LHR's Terminal 4 it was very easy to get to (and if you are arriving/departing from any of LHR's other terminals, it s a quick ride - complimentary - on the Heathrow Express train to Terminal 4)
<Overall> 4
