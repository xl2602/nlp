<Title> Pleasant Stay
<Content> I recently had a one night stay in Oakland. The Imperial Inn was a fraction of the price of the upscale hotels in the city that evening, so I took a chance with this motel. I was pleasantly surprised. The front desk attendant was very friendly. My room faced the courtyard and was pretty quiet. The space was fairly large and nicely appointed. The bathroom was adequate. Direct TV, flat screen TV and decent wifi connection were nice bonuses. The property is just north of downtown and is close to a BART station and freeway access.
<Overall> 4
