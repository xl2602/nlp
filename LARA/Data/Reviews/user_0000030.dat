<Title> Comfort and convenient to Milano Centrale
<Content> Hotel Berna is very close to Milan Central Station, super-convenient for business or pleasure travel. The staff was completely on top of things from the time we made our reservation online thru our stay, including attention to details (for example, the bellman ensured that we had bottled water when we were going out on a hot day!). This is a professional operation with real attention to customer service, a clean comfortable [superior] room, and generous breakfast with a selection of international newspapers available for the guests.
