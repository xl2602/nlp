<Title> A decent B&B sort of place but nothing too special.
<Content> The bathroom were small with no windows, and there are no open areas inside. The two courtyards are well finished but are closed from all sides and the top, this does make the place feel a bit dark, even during the day. The food at dinner was so-so, and breakfast is quite basic also, with no cooked dishes.
<Overall> 3
