<Title> Great value for money
<Content> My sister and I were very pleased with Hotel Gruenwald. It's a little way out of the city, but still quite conveniently located, only ten minutes' walk from an S-Bahn station, and then a pretty short train ride into central Munich (Marienplatz: 17 minutes). The nearby streets are very quiet at night
<Overall> 5
