<Title> Staff, Location, Food. Great Stay here.
<Content> For our most recent visit to Siem Reap we decided to stay at Viroth?€?s. This is an excellent hotel. It is relatively new and should not be confused with the old Viroth?€?s on Street 23, which is now named Viroth?€?s Villa. The hotel is on Street 24
