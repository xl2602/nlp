<Title> A great place, especially for the price!
<Content> The bed was splendid, the room clean and with adequate size and furnishings, the shower was as it should be, the reading lights were fine--we are glad we found this place. And, I had not expected a breakfast that included waffles and hard boiled eggs as well as apples, yoghurt, and other basics. The internet worked easily and splendidly. We will stay here again when we are between Florida and the northeast on I 95!
