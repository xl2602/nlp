<Title> Great but Dated
<Content> Went here for business and enjoyed it. Remember NY hotels are old buildings. So they try to update but still can tell they are old. Slept great, staff was great and food was great. Would I come back? Yes. Kids my not enjoy it but a great place. Needs a lobby with a view. This hotel is only steps away from The Plaza Hotel and Central Park. Great location.
<Overall> 4
