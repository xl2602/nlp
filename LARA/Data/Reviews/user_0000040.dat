<Title> A well appointed hotel
<Content> I stayed at the Grand Hyatt on a business trip for 4 nights in October (6th to 10th). The public spaces in the hotel are nicely designed, and decorated and are very relaxing. Check in staff were welcoming and pleasant (took a wee bit of time to sort out the issue of the hotel not front loading our credit guards in guarantee of guest expenditure during our stay - they settled on a zero balance - I don't like the approach of hotel's front loading credit cards!)
<Overall> 4
