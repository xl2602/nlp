<Title> Great location
<Content> Typical hotel from the Marriott chain but generally less expensive than the Marriott just around the corner. Bar area is quiet nice with a decent amount of seating and beer is a reasonable price. I didn't eat in the hotel's restaurant so cannot comment on the food. The rooms are standard and what you would expect from this chain and as such are reasonably comfortable. My room overlooked the street but was fairly quiet. Air-conditioning didn't appear to be great/easy to change room temperature so watch out if you stay in summer, although I'm sure the staff would be pleased to help if you had problems. I had a minor problem with my room on the first night and it was dealt with quickly and efficiently, even though I tried to explain the problem with my best pigeon German (the staff all speak perfect English of course). Easy to find and in a great location for the Inner Alster and the U-bahn, and only 5-10 mins away from a good steak restaurant called Block House. Additionally, if you are a trendy shopper the location couldn't be better. Grosse Bleichen has to be the most expensive shopping in Hamburg, with goods on offer at prices that would make a Russian oligarch wince. Very impressive/depressing to window shop depending on your view of capitalism. Don't bring the wife (or anyone else's) because it will cost you a fortune.
