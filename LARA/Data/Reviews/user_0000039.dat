<Title> Wonderful surprise in Ardmore
<Content> This is our first stay at this La Quinta. We will definitely stay here again. The location, right off of Hwy. 35, was perfect on our drive through. The hotel looks & feels very new and was very clean & comfortable. Nice lobby & breakfast/cocktail room. Nice size rooms, comfy bed & pillows, nice bathroom. They have an indoord pool & workout room that look very nice, but we didn't use them. You can tell that the staff & owners take a lot of pride in the hotel. The staff is wonderful & very kind. The breakfast was good. They are dog friendly, which is very good for us & our little pup. There is plenty of nice grass & walking area. We felt it was a good price for the value.
<Overall> 5
