<Title> The ONLY place to stay in Riga
<Content> My first trip to Riga and I am already waiting to come back. The location is the very best, easy access to all sites in the old city and the shopping malls. The service and the personal attention to details are truly impressive, and you are treated as an individual not as a "guest". The SPA is part of the hotel that should not be missed, the facilities are great - but the team is even better. On the top of all the restaurant is offering food at a level of a top Michelin star restaurant. You must allow one night to have dinner ( some nights there is nice live music as well), you will not regret.
<Overall> 5
