<Title> Enjoyed our stay at Radisson SAS
<Content> We spent 3 nights at the Radisson SAS in Prague over the Easter weekend and enjoyed our stay. We stayed in a Junior Suite room on the 8th floor. Room was very comfortable with a small couch and chair. The room had a small coffee pot for making tea or coffee which I always appreciate. The bathroom was very spacious with two sinks, a tub, and a shower. The breakfast buffet was great.
