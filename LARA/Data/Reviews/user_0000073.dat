<Title> Amazing New Year's Eve!
<Content> This is our third visit to Aleenta & the only place will have ever returned to & intend to return again! James & his team excelled themselves this time with the New Year's Eve celebrations - "Fire & Ice" & everything nice! What a spectacle! Ice sculpting (chain saws & ice picks!), fire dancers & a volcano - what more could you ask? The food was excellent (of course) service exemplary & the atmosphere amazing! For us it was special to spend the new year with old friends & new friends! We will be back! Thank you James you are a star & very special to us
