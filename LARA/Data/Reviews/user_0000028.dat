<Title> Very basic
<Content> Parking on narrow street. Walk up steep stairs to rooms, we were given our key in the lobby and told how to get to our room upstairs. Room very basic, ensuite very small with wash basin in bedroom section and door that opens out to bedroom because of the small ensuite size. However, it was an ok stopover B&B for overnight. Breakfast very basic, only fresh fruit was bananas with dried prunes, sultanas and apricots in glass jars. Usual English breakfast served only between 8.30am to 9am.only 5 minutes walk to town
<Overall> 3
