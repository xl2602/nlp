<Title> Great service
<Content> We were staying in Anaheim to visit Disneyland. We were looking for a nice property that wouldn't break the bank but still had great service. Check in was smooth and the staff were very helpful. The suites had lots of room for a family to spread out. We seemed to have forgotten everything so I felt like I was calling the front desk constantly, but they were always chipper and eager to help. The only thing wrong with the suite was the sink. It had an unusual jut out that meant my daughter could not reach the taps to wash her hands. I called the front desk again and they came up with a step for her. I would highly recommend this property. We walked to Disney both days one way but took shuttles home. It is a 20 minute walk but after a long day at the park, it is hard walk with a little one.
<Overall> 5
