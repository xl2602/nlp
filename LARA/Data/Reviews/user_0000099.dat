<Title> A very pleasant stay near Universal Studios Hollywood
<Content> Overall, our 2-night stay at Mikado was very good. The room was clean, the queen-size bed was comfortable, and all other listed amenities were available (free wi-fi, frdige with separate freezer compartment, coffee maker, 2 luggage racks, clean towels, etc.) The hotel also gave us a 10% coupon at their adjacent Japanese restaurant (also named Mikado) and we ate there and had a very good dinner. The front desk also provided me with a disposable razor and shaving cream when I asked as I forgot to bring those items with me on this trip so that was much appreciated. The only thing that I would suggest to improve the whole experience is that the room we stayed in might benefit from is a new coat of paint as the current one seems due for one and a bit of rust shows in the door hinges of the bath room. But we would not hesitate to come back and stay at this hotel. It was convenient to get on/off US101 (exit ramp was a short drive to/from the hotel) and driving to Universal Studios theme park area was a quick 10 minute drive via US101 and about 15 minutes via local streets.
<Overall> 4
