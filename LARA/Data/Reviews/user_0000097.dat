<Title> Great Stay
<Content> We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. The location is on the Green Line, stops at Lavender. After getting out of the MRT, turn left to take the elevator to street level. Outside of the hotel are many local eateries. There is a small shopping mall directly across the street, with a local food court.
<Overall> 4
