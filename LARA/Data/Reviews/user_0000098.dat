<Title> Nice business hotel
<Content> Good business hotel located outside the morning traffic jam, so you can reach the business center in National Digital Park easily via taxi. Rooms are quiet and clean. The personnel is nice and professional. Good breakfast area and good taxi service. A bit far from city center, so should not be a good option if you?â‚¬?re there on holiday.
<Overall> 3
