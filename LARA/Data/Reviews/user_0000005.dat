<Title> A comparison with the Paraiso
<Content> We stayed at the Iberostar Paraiso Beach last year, so this review compares the two hotels. We decided to stay in this one because we thought we'd want to be closer to Playa del Carmen, and we wanted to try a new one. In the end we went into town only once, so it wasn't worth the crowds or the extra money. The resorts themselves are quite similar architecturally. They are laid out the same with two identical hotels on either side. We felt like we were at the same hotel. There is a shared pool in the center with matching breakfast/lunch buffets on either side of the beach. We liked that everything is close together in the Quetzal/ Tucan. However the pool is bigger and better at the the Paraiso, and the beach is cleaner with clearer water and less crowded. The pool at the Quetzal was deep and not nearly as big. For kids the Paraiso pool is superior because it had a few levels so you weren't always swimming. There is only one swim up bar. As I recall, there were several at the Paraiso. The rooms are the same, but the Paraiso there was more room. Sadly the beach is not so great. There are a lot of hotels and the water can get clouded up. It smells like diesel fuel from all the jet skis. If you are out of town, say at the Paraiso, the water is clearer and there are fewer jet skis to stink up the place. The down side to the Paraiso is that it is quite large and there is definitely more walking from place to place. The evening buffets were about the same. The Paraiso had bar service in the main buffets. Quetzal did not.

<Title> good location, bad hotel
<Content> Stayed there 4 nights. 1. The location is very convenient, right next to a subway and a little restaurant where you can have a good breakfast. 2. Standard welcome, nothing special to say. 3. The floor in our room was completely wet when we get in. We immediately called the front desk and ask to be changed when we'll be back from our dinner. Then we got out to have dinner. When we came back nobody knew about the change request and we had to explain and show again. We finally got another room, better. 4. The carpet seemed old... and certainly not hygienic (stains, bad feeling about it...). Very standard bathroom, not refurbished for a while. 5. The persons at the front desk were not helpful, working like robots. We won't come again.
