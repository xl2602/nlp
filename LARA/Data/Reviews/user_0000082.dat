<Title> Perfect Location, great hotel 
<Content> We're just back from a 4 night stay in Prague in Grand Bohemia hotel. It's in a fantastic location, right around the corner from the old town square. On arrival we were delighted to be told we had been upgraded to the Steiner Suite. It was amazing like a mini apartment with views of the city. When we return we will definitely book this hotel again and the Steiner Suite!
