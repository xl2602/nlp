<Title> Great Location, Friendly Staff, Some Improvements Needed
<Content> This hotel is in a central location in downtown Charlotte, with easy access to restaurants and nightlife. The valet staff was extremely friendly and efficient. The hotel staff in general were very friendly (except for an issue mentioned below). The rooms were clean and the blackout curtains kept the room dark in the mornings. I did not use the gym, but I did walk through it, and its a nice, full sized gym. There is a nice main restaurant, and little shops and quick service restaurants, such as chick-fil-a just under the lobby area.
<Overall> 4
