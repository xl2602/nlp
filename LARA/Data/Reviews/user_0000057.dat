<Title> Great location but far too expensive
<Content> This hotel is right in front of Ipanema beach with about 20 meters to the beach and another 50 meters to the water. The view from the rooms are nothing but great - from early morning to late night. There is also a number of decent restaurants within walking distance, in an area of the city that feels safe all day round. The personnel is not very efficient but very friendly and helpful. The breakfast is also delicious with lots of options. The rooms are well-kept although a bit warm and noisy, especially when you have a room towards the beach and the road. The rooftop pool is so tiny that it should not be called a pool, the sitting area is far from cosy, and the adjoining bar was closed all days I stayed there. With the price that you have to pay each night, the rating cannot be higher than average. If you are cost-conscious I would suggest to stay at a cheaper place with the same quality. If you are not cost-conscious, there are lots of more elegant places overlooking the beach.
