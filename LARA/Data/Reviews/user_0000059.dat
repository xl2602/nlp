<Title> Still far from where it should be
<Content> The Hilton Athens was an institution. The area is named after it after all. I like the architecture and the furniture. The room has been fitted with a new tv since the last time i stayed here (11 months ago). Service varies but the staff seems altogether happier than last year. Today was the first time the porter ever greeted me hello. Although usually you never see the porter present especially when you arrive and take your bags out of the car.
