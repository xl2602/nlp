<Title> a great Riu property
<Content> This is our third stay at a Riu property and the second in Cancun (we previously stayed at the Riu Las Americas). The Riu Palace Peninsula delivers the same great service we have begun to expect from Riu, and although there are common elements throughout the chain of hotels, each one has its own unique personality- this one is no exception. I concur with most of the reviews here, but wanted to add just a couple comments
<Overall> 4
