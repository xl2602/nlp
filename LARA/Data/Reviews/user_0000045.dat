<Title> Fantastic Views
<Content> We stayed at these apartments from 18th to 25th June. I was apprehensive before I arrived as some of the reviews weren't great. However, there was no need to worry, our 2 bed apartment was lovely and the views were amazing. The apartment had everything we needed, was quiet, clean and was lovely to sit on the balcony and look out to sea with a nice glass of wine before heading out to dinner. The pool was also gorgeous with lots of sun loungers etc. The bar/food area has recently been taken over by a young guy - Javier/Javie, he was so lovely, so helpful answering any questions we had about the area. We had lunch there one day and it was really lovely and good value. Some reviewers has said the reception staff aren't helpful/friendly.....true, they are not particularly "welcoming" but it's not a hotel and it certainly didn't affect our stay. The apartments are in a perfect location, a lift down to the promenade with beach/shops/restaurants etc, or behind the apartments there is also access to the main town and some lovely restaurants right behind the apartment, 2 min walk away which were really great. We went to Aqualand (we had two teenagers with us), to be honest it was a bit of a rip-off, lots of hanging around waiting to get on rides, so not really value for money. We absolutely loved our stay and would stay again if visiting the area. Highly recommend.
