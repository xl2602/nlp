<Title> Great hotel for late stopover & early morning flight
<Content> This was a short 1 night stay as we had an early flight to Phuket on Silk Air. Hotel room was very nice and spacious for myself & two boys (15 & 9). Breakfast was ordinary and when it came to paying the bill they said only one breakfast was included in the rate. Luckily I had the printed confirmation stating 2 adult breakfasts included. After double checking with the manager the amount was credited. How complicated can it be
<Overall> 4
