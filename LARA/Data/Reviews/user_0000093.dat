<Title> Hotel is beside a mall and subway station but out of the city center.
<Content> We stayed here for 3 nights, Sept 25-27, 2011. The hotel is beside a mall and a subway station but out of the city center. Rooms are ok but the glass shower cover is only 1/3 of the side so water was splashing on the bathroom floor as one takes a shower.
<Overall> 3
