<Title> Great place to stay
<Content> Stayed two nights and wish we had longer. We found rooms large and very clean. our safe broke on the 1st night and we had everything locked inside. we reported to reception who had it dealt with in a few hours but as we had no cash kindly lent me some from their own wallets! We had breakfast included and found it good. There is a shopping area across the road and to our joy a CV sypermarket, could not believe the prices for wine etc. Brilliant. Did the 17 mile drive, excellent. Pool is nice especially the hot tub. Overall a very pleasant relaxing stay and hope to go back next year.
