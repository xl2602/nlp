<Title> Good Courtyard property, yet more expensive
<Content> I stayed here because all the large hotels near the Music City convention center were full. It was an excellent location that was 2 blocks from Broadway, within 2-4 blocks of many restaurants, next to Printer's Alley, and about 5-6 blocks from the convention center
<Overall> 4
