<Title> Beautiful resort
<Content> We decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary at this resort because of the much lauded beach and quiet location and were not disappointed. The Resort is beautiful with a perfect location away from the city of Abu Dhabi but still within reach. Rooms are well appointed and tastefully decorated throughout, bed was extremely comfortable and bathroom had the best layout I ever seen in a 5 star hotel with a huge walk-in shower. The big draw for us was the beach with its turquoise clear sea water and the adult swimming pool, a heaven of peace and tranquillity, where to relax with cocktails and light lunches from the adjacent pool restaurant. We ate at the Olea restaurant which had a vast selection of dishes of excellent quality and very well executed. We also ate the Grill 55 were we had a faultless meal
<Overall> 5
