<Title> Great location
<Content> We visited Athens for a couple of days in late October. We picked this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and were overall pleased with our choice. Great location, within easy walking distance of restaurants and shops. Fantastic rooftop bar area overlooking the Acropolis. The breakfast buffet offered a great selection
