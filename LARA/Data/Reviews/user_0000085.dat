<Title> A very late review for our August 2011 stay, but still perfect in every way!!
<Content> Hello to our beloved Bougainvillea!!! Apologies for the extreme delay in our review - truth is I thought I did this when we came back but unfortunately it did not post! If it says anything, August 2011 was our first trip to Barbados and we have been back 4 times in the last year. Upon arriving to the resort, we were greeted by the always friendly Melissa, who was so kind and sweet. She let us know they were just putting the finishing touches on our room and gave us free drink tickets to go have a famous rum punch on them. How sweet!
