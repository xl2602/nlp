<Title> I think I know the secret
<Content> This is not the newest , not the fanciest, not the most technically advanced. So, why does it get high ratings? Because it is the friendliest hotel in the world. From the moment you are greeted at the door, it seems that everyone cares about you and your well being. And it is not phoney, but genuine. The room was OK, nice size, but a small window facing a center courtyard. Totally silent, perfect fast wifi, comfy bed, nice (small) bathroom. Furnishings were not the most modern, but again, just clean and comfortable. A turndown service was a pleasant touch. Free breakfast a remarkable bonus. I love this place and will repeat visit again and again. I wish every hotel was like this one.
