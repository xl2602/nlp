<Title> Beautiful location
<Content> I stayed in a basic onsite van (an old fixed caravan) and was happy with my choice for the price. Although the caravan was a little musty, the linens were clean and the mattress comfy. The bathrooms were close by and were generally clean. They took a bit of a hammering over the Easter break, but cleaning staff seemed to be keeping well on top of it. All staff I encountered were pleasant and helpful. The beach is stunning and the site is in a good spot to walk to Cathedral Cove. The holiday park has wifi you can pay for or computer terminals. There is a shop in the village and a couple of places to eat. This very much feels like a family holiday place, not for those up for wild nightlife. I did not have a car, and this made exploring the wider area challenging. I ended up walking and hitching to Hot Water Beach. There is a shuttle which operates in the area, but this was a little expensive for just one person.
<Overall> 4
