<Title> Fabulous service, great rooms and a must stay if in Pudong
<Content> from the minute you enter this hotel, the look, the feel, the genuine and perfect service, you wont want to stay anywhere else in Pudong. The rooms are large, spacious and very light with the floor to ceiling windows. The Japanese restaurant here is also a must as the food is to die for from the great chef and the lobby has a fantastic luxurious feel to it.
