<Title> Hip boutique hotel in Copenhagen
<Content> Recently went to Copenhagen for a business trip and fell in love with it again. A big part of that was the wonderful experience I had at SP34. The hotel is located in the older part of the city, walking distance to lot's of points of interest and great shopping. The design is fantastic--modern, yet timeless Danish style with a lot of personality. Rooms are well appointed with lot's of light, great furniture and Ren toiletries (wow!). Hotel staff is warm and friendly and the breakfast is fantastic. HIGHLY recommend.
