<Title> driving from ATL to TEXAS - along I-12
<Content> Slidell, LA a convenient stop near Baton Rouge and this exit has a mall, lots of choices to dine. Would stop here again and compare pricing of nearby hotels. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. It's a 3 story hotel. They do accept dogs so ask for a room on the 3rd floor if you don't want to hear late night barking and begging to go for a walk. I always like a free breakfast!
