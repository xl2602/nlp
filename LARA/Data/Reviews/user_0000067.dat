<Title> Two Thumb Up for Hospitality!!!
<Content> My husband and I have stayed at most of the five star luxury resorts in the Napa area including Meadowood, Carneros Inn, Calistoga Ranch, and Solage Calistoga. Auberge du Soleil definitely takes the cake when it comes to hospitality and breathtaking views of the Napa valley (Meadowood and Calistoga Ranch are both nestled among trees whereas Solage Calistoga and Carneros are nestled among the vineyards and farmlands)
<Overall> 5
