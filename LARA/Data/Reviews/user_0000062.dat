<Title> So convenient, and fantastic staff
<Content> We stayed at the Airport La Quinta 3 nights on arrival from UK and one night before flying home - it is so convenient for the Airport and yet you can't hear any airport noises. The reception staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and made you feel really comfortable. Rooms as in other La Quinta's we have stayed at were spacious, very clean and comfortable and the breakfast room was very well laid out and free internet accessible in the foyer. Felt really comfortable at this hotel. Only a short drive (about 10 minutes) into Salt Lake City itself - which was the real surprise of our trip - really enjoyed our visit.
