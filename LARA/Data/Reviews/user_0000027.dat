<Title> Should Have Known Better
<Content> Was obliged to stay at this hotel as it was one of the last hotels to have available rooms during a city-wide convention. After staying at the other Delta a year ago, and it was atrocious, I should have known better. The staff and service here isn't terrible, it's also not great, but it's the only redeeming quality in what can only be described as a high-rise motel. Apparently the place is being renovated. Good because the room I stayed in would embarrass the Bates Motel. Carpet had visible waves, box tv circa '76, bathroom lighting, well, it's hard to believe the local building code permits the dim levels. Wifi doesn't work in the lobby areas, though it's supposed to.
