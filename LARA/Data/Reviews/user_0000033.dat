<Title> The Angled Suite review--Felt cheated.
<Content> I had a 1 bedroom terrace suite with a fountain view booked and I have stayed in that room type before and it is posh and stylish. When I checked in yesterday, I was offered an "upgrade" to an Angled suite which is about 200 sqft larger. I thought...sure why not although I thought it was strange they don't show it on their website. So up we go and the elevator doors open on the 59th floor and I was astonished that the carpet around the elevator area were so dirty and cheap looking. I didn't feel like I was at the Cosmo. The furnishings in the room were cheap and the carpet ugly. It was clean but ugly. Instead of the posh blue velvet couch, there were 2 chairs with ottomans that were covered in some type of plastic or vinyl. In front of the chairs was a TV mounted on the wall. I did like the fact that the room had 2 full baths. One was small but very nice. The larger one was very nice. There was just a lot of wasted space and not enough seating. I felt like I was cheated out of the nice room I booked to some type of overflow room. It did have a longer balcony with 2 sets of oversized chairs and ottoman. One was on one end of the balcony and the other was way over on the other end. I found that funny. I guess I would have to scream at the person on the other end of the balcony to have a conversation. Now I know why this room is not on their website.
