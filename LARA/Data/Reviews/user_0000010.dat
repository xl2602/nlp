<Title> Faded Grandeur
<Content> Stayed on the executive floor but somehow the service just isn?â‚¬?t there. The place is tired, needs a facelift and the staff (on the executive floor) need to relax a little and be less in your face. The lounge there is small and lacks facilities and a decent selection for breakfast. The rooms are fine and the wifi works but somehow when you are spending this sort of money, there are better places available elsewhere in Yangon.
<Overall> 3
