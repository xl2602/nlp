<Title> Great beach access, poor food and room quality
<Content> Stayed here for a destination wedding that was being held at the Divi All-Inclusive. The one good thing about this hotel is that its not a high rise resort, and the the beach access and views from the rooms are amazing. Thats about it though. The rooms are old, the bathrooms are worn down (rust and dirty grout and missmatched tiles in our shower). The buffet food was horrible, dirty and most times cold (even thought it was in heating dishes). The tables were dirty. I would recommend staying at the Divi All Inclusive instead, there is a HUGE difference and not much of a difference in money. The food was better there, as were the rooms. The only other positive thing to say about Tamarijn was the food at the restaurant Paparazzi was OKAY at best. I would not return to this resort, i would stay at Divi instead.
<Overall> 3
