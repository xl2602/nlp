In this project, we show how to extract user preference for different aspects of hotel with weight by automatically analyzing reviews. 

* Built a new dataset which contains in total 60,463 unique users and 763,895 hotel reviews from TripAdvisor. 
* Adopt a bootstrapping-based algorithm and a Latent Rating Regression (LRR) model (Wang et al., 2010) to segment aspects and calculate weights of the corresponding aspect based on each user’s review history. 
* Analysis and visualizations of outputs from different locations highlight the potential of using weight as an indicator of user preference, which can also be used to support hotel recommendation system.
